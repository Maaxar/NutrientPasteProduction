# NutrientPasteProduction
A mod for Rimworld that allows production of nutrient paste at the Biofuel Refinery.

Does not alter the vanilla paste dispenser.
	
Allows the production of nutrient paste meals (either single meals or a batch of 10 meals) at the Biofuel Refinery.
	
Requires completing the vanilla "Nutrient Paste" research project to enable the recipe.
	
Has the same nutrient cost as vanilla nutrient paste (0.3 nutrition per meal), the same restrictions on ingredients (any raw food, but no plant matter like Hops or Hay), and does not remove the human or insect meat tags from the completed meals. Also does not require cooking skill, it is assigned under crafting, and uses the pawn's Unskilled Labor Speed.
	
I tried to create a reasonable work amount/production time.
	
Let me know if you think anything needs to be adjusted for balance.
