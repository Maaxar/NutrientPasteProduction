# NutrientPasteProduction
A mod for RimWorld

Allows the production of 2 varieties of nutrient paste meals (either one at a time or a batch of 10 meals) at the Biofuel Refinery or the Drug Lab.

Requires completing the vanilla "Nutrient Paste" research project to enable the recipe.

2 nutrient paste varieties:

1) Regular nutrient paste meal: produces the vanilla "nutrient paste meal".

Has the same nutrient cost as vanilla nutrient paste (0.3 nutrition per meal), the same restrictions on ingredients (any raw food, but no plant matter like Hops or Hay), and does not remove the human or insect meat tags from the completed meals.

2) Refined nutrient paste meal: produces the "nutrient paste meal (refined)".

Makes a heavily processed nutrient paste meal by extracting nutrients from any organic material (including plant matter and haygrass). Takes twice as long to make as regular nutrient paste meals, but the ingredients are no longer recognizable to any pawn who eats it.

Making meals does not require cooking skill, it is assigned under crafting, and uses the pawn's Unskilled Labor Speed.
	
I tried to create a reasonable work amount/production time.

Does not alter or affect the vanilla paste dispenser.

Change Log:

v0.1.0.0 - initial release

v0.1.1.0 - Added a recipe for "nutrient paste meal (refined)": Makes a heavily processed nutrient paste meal by extracting nutrients from any organic material (including plant matter and haygrass). Takes twice as long to make as regular nutrient paste meals, but the ingredients are no longer recognizable to any pawn who eats it. Also added the ability to make both the regular and refined nutrient pastes at either the Biofuel Refinery or the Drug Lab. Nutrient Paste research is still required for the recipe to appear.

Let me know if you think anything needs to be adjusted for balance.
